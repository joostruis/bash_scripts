# bash_scripts

A collection of useful, practical Bash scripts for Linux systems. These scripts are written to be readable, efficient, and easy to extend. Theyâ€™re primarily aimed at system administrators, power users, and developers who work with Linux regularly.

## Included Scripts

scan-broken-libs.sh  
  Scans common system directories for ELF binaries with missing shared library dependencies using ldd. Helps identify broken system packages or orphaned files.

  - Skips known false positives (e.g., plugin folders, dynamically loaded modules)
  - Scans /usr, /lib, /bin, /sbin, etc.
  - Separates definitely broken from possibly ignorable issues
  - MIT Licensed

More scripts will be added over time.
